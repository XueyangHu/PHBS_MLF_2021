Discuss ion of Repurchase Agreement Arrange-
ments 

Participants resumed thei r discussion from the April 
2021 FOMC meeting of considerat ions rela ted to the es-
tablishmen t of a domestic standing repurchase agree-
ment (repo) facility (SRF) and a standing Foreign In ter-
national Monetary Authori ties (FIMA) repo facility.  
Building on discussion at previous meetings, the staff 
presen ted considera tions for how these facilities might 
be designed.  The design considera tions were guided by

participants’ general d esire to have these facili ties play a 
backstop role in fostering effective implemen tation of 
monetary poli cy and supporting smooth functioning of 
markets.  In April, participants highlighted the im-
portance of designing these facilities in a way that would 
leave ample room for p rivate market ac tivity while min-
imizing the potential for stigma, promote equitable ac-
cess to an appropriately broad set of counterpar ties, and 
be governed by the FOMC.  W ith these principles and 
goals in mind, the staff presented poten tial te rms for 
each facility.   
The staff presentation on the potential design of a do-
mestic SRF included establishing the minimum bid rate 
at 25 basis points— the top of the ta rget range fo r the 
federal funds rate.  The staff briefing suggested counter-
parties for the facility would include primary dealers and 
would be extended ove r time to include banks that ex-
pressed interes t in participation.  The staff presentation 
noted that such a facility could be limited to only U.S. 
Treasury securities or could accept all securities currently 
accepted in open marke t opera tions (OMOs), which in-
clude Treasury securities, agency securities, and agency 
mortgage-backed s ecuritie s (MBS).  The briefing noted 
that, on the one hand, res tric ting eligible collate ral for a 
domestic SRF to U.S. Treasury securities could mitigate 
concerns that an SRF could encourage counterparties to 
take on greater liquidity risk.  On the othe r hand, accept-
ing agency securities and agency MBS in an SRF would 
be consistent with the s truc ture of curren t repo opera-
tions and could help address a greater range of potential 
repo marke t pressu res from spilling over in to the federal 
funds market. 
The proposed design for a standing FIMA repo facility 
was similar in structure to the exis ting tempo rary FIMA 
repo facili ty.  Under the draft terms, the range of eligible 
counterparties for the FIMA repo facility would con-
tinue to include foreign official institutions, largely com-
prising cen tral banks, subject to individual approval.  
The eligible collateral would continue to be limited to 
U.S. Treasury securities.  The draft terms envisioned that 
the rate for the FIMA repo facility would be set equal to 
the top of the target range for the fede ral funds rate, a 
rate equal to the minimum bid ra te in the draf t te rms for 
the domestic SRF. 
In their discussion of considerations related to the de-
sign of a domestic SRF, a substantial majority res tated 
their view, conveyed at the April 2021 mee ting, tha t the 
poten tial benefits of such a facility outweighed the po-
tential costs.  Participants broadly supported the terms 

presen ted by the s taff for such a facility.  Several partic-
ipants noted the importance of setting the minimum bid 
rate high enough so that the facility was positioned as a 
backstop, while some poin ted out the impor tance of not 
setting the rate so high that usage of the facility could be 
stigmatized o r tha t the facility would not sufficiently 
contain p ressures tha t could spill ove r into the federal 
funds market.  Several participants no ted tha t setting an 
SRF rate at the top of the target range for the federal 
funds rate would be consistent with addressing pressures 
that could spill over to the federal funds market.  Others 
remarked that se tting the SRF rate a t the same level as 
the primary credit rate for borrowing at the discount 
window would promote equitable a ccess to Federal Re-
serve liquidity across banks and counte rpar ties for 
OMOs.  Several participan ts commented that it may also 
be approp riate to adjust the SRF rate ove r time based on 
accumulated experience and economi c or financial de-
velopmen ts.  Several participants suggested that, in order 
to ensure an SRF continues to be effective, it may be 
approp riate to study the cos ts and benefits of additional 
adjustments over time, such as moving to a cleared set-
tlement structure.  Most participants noted the benefits 
of allowing banks to be counterparties to a domestic 
SRF, including more direc tly addressing liquidity pres-
sures for participants in the federal funds marke t and 
promoting equitable access to liquidity across domestic 
counterparties.  Many par ticipan ts judged that i t would 
be approp riate to accep t the same set of securities that is 
currentl y accep ted for OMOs.  Some participants indi-
cated that accepting these securi ties in the dom estic 
SRF’s operations should increase the effectiveness of the 
facility in limiting upward pressures in repo markets that 
could spill over into the federal funds market.  Some 
other par ticipan ts noted that limiting accep table securi-
ties for SRF operations to U.S. Treasury securities could 
have benefits, including consistency with the regulatory 
distinction between U.S. Treasury securities and other 
types of securities, potentiall y limiting the Federal Re-
serve’s footp rint in financial marke ts, and maintaining 
consistency with the structure of the proposed FIMA 
repo facility and the overnigh t reverse repo (ON RRP) 
facility.  Several participants cautioned that es tablishing 
a backstop SRF would not diminish the importance of 
providing a sufficien tly ample supply of reserves on an 
ongoing basis or the need to improve the structural re-
siliency of the U.S. Treasury market.  A couple of pa rtic-
ipants reiterated their concerns abou t conve rting current 
ongoing daily repo opera tions to a standing facility and 
suggested ways to calibrate the terms o f the facili ty to 
mitigate these concerns, including setting a relatively

high minimum bid rate or limiting securities eligible for 
SRF operations to only U.S. Treasury securities. 
In their discussion of considerations related to the de-
sign of a standing FIMA repo facility, a substantial ma-
jority supported the b road structure discussed in the 
staff presenta tion.  Many participants generally saw ben-
efits in keep ing the ra te at the same level as tha t in the 
poten tial domestic SRF in light of the similar nature of 
the transactions and high quality o f the collate ral.  A 
number of participants rema rked tha t the ra te at the 
FIMA repo fa cility could be set a t a higher l evel than at 
the domestic SRF or could be set at a level comparable 
to tha t in the Federal Rese rve’s dollar liquidity swap 
lines.  A couple of participants commented on the po-
tential repu tational risks of establishing a standing FIMA 
repo facility, including those associated with p roviding 
liquidity on a standing basis to a wider se t of cen tral 
banks and finance ministries than through existing swap 
lines.  These participants rei terated the impor tance of 
maintaining well-defined criteria for participat ion in the 
facility and suggested that the FOMC should receive reg-
ular reports on the operations and counterpar ties ap-
proved for a standing FIMA repo facili ty. 
Participants agreed that they would continue thei r dis-
cussion of design parameters for both a domestic SRF 
and a standing FIMA repo facility.  The Chair asked the 
staff to work on a specific proposal that reflected the 
views expressed by participants at this mee ting. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 

The manager turned first to a discussion of financial 
market developments ove r the intermeeting period.  On 
net, U.S. financial conditions eased further, led by a de-
cline in Treasury yields.  Lower term premiums appeared 
to be a significant componen t of the declines, as re-
flected by lower implied volatili ty on longer-te rm inter-
est rates.  Equiti es rose sligh tly, the b road dollar weak-
ened, and credit sp reads were little changed at his tori-
cally tight levels. 
Over the period, market participants focused on data 
showing lower employment growth and higher infla tion 
readings than had been expected.  The median 2021 core 
personal consumption expendi tures (PCE) inflation 
forecast from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Pri-
mary Dealers jumped nearly 1 percentage poin t from the 
previous survey.  However, median forecas ts for 2022 
and 2023 each rose less than 0.1 percent, suggesting ex-
pectations for infla tiona ry pressure s to subside.  Infla-
tion compensation as measured by five-year breakeven 
rates on Treasury Inflation-Pro tec ted Securities peaked 

in mid-May at the highes t level in more than a decade, 
but the increase was driven almost en tirely by highe r in-
flation compensa tion at shor t horizons.  Indeed, one-
year-forward inflation compensation at horizons beyond 
a year was relatively stable.     
Measures of expec tations for Fed eral Reserve policy 
were little changed over the period.  The median re-
sponden t to the Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and 
market par ticipan ts continued to expect the pace of Fed-
eral Reserve asset purchases to begin to decline in the 
first quarter o f 2022, although most respond ents also 
saw a reasonable chance that this decline could occur 
one quarter earli er or la ter.  The median respond ent ex-
pected purchases to end in the fourth quarter of 2022.  
The Desk’s survey measures of the expected path of the 
target federal funds rate were also fairly steady, and the 
median respondent con tinued to expect the first target 
rate increase to occur in the third quarter of 2023.  
Nearly all Desk survey respondents anticipa ted that the 
Summary of Economic Projec tions would show the me-
dian Committee par ticipan t proj ecting ei ther no increase 
in the target range or one ¼ percentage point increase 
by the end of 2023. 
The manager noted that downward pressure on money 
market rates continued over the period.  Banks contin-
ued to limit growth in their balance sheets by allowing 
wholesale liabilities to mature and encouraging custom-
ers to shift some nonopera tional deposi ts to money mar-
ket funds.  Moreover, the supply of Treasury bills, a pri-
mary investment fo r governm ent money marke t mutual 
funds, fell further.  Against this backdrop, the Secured 
Overnigh t Financ ing Rate (SOFR) printed at 1 basis 
point each day in the intermee ting period, while the ef-
fective fede ral funds rate (EFFR) decreas ed 1 basis 
point, to 6 basis points.   
Amid heightened demand and reduced suppl y for short-
term investments, the ON RRP continued to maintain a 
floor on overnigh t rate s.  Growth in the ON RRP and 
other nonrese rve liabili ties helped expand the base of 
Federal Reserve liabili ties suppo rting asse t purchases, 
damping the increase in rese rves and easing pressure on 
bank balance sheets.   
Over the nex t inte rmeet ing period, the manage r antici-
pated tha t furthe r increas es in reserves and reduc tions in 
bill supply could put additional downward pressure on 
overnigh t rates.  A modest technical adjustment to ad-
ministered ra tes could be warran ted to maintain the 
EFFR well within the target range and support smooth 
functioning of short-te rm funding markets.  Such an ad-
justment would be expected to rais e the federal funds 

Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
rate and to lift othe r overnigh t rates modestl y.  Most re-
sponden ts to the Desk’s surveys expected an adminis-
tered ra te adjustment this summer.  The manager noted 
that balances at the ON RRP facility would likely con-
tinue to grow over coming months.  The staff would 
continue to moni tor developments, and the manager 
noted tha t, at some poin t, it could become approp riate 
to conside r raising the coun terpa rty limits for the ON 
RRP.  
The manager provided an update on progress toward 
winding down a number of emergency facili ties estab-
lished under section 13(3) of the Fede ral Reserve Act.  
While market participants took note of the Fed eral Re-
serve Board’s announcemen t on winding down the Sec-
ondary Market Corporate Credi t Facility (SMCCF) hold-
ings, it elicited little price respons e.  The commencement 
of exchange-trad ed funds sales proceeded smoo thly.  All 
of the SMCCF assets are expected to be sold by the end 
of this year. 
Finally, the manager noted a proposal to request the 
Chair’s approval fo r an extension to the tempora ry U.S. 
dollar liquidity swap arrangements to December 31, 
2021.  The extension would benefit the U.S. economy by 
helping fores tall po tential pressures in offsho re dollar 
funding markets that could spill over to U.S. financial 
conditions while much of the global economy remains 
on an uncertain recovery path from the pandemic.  
Should the Committee decide to make the FIMA repo 
facility standing, an extension would also provide suffi-
cient time for those temporary swap line central banks 
that are no t currently en rolled in the FIMA repo facility 
to do so and to become fully operational. 
Secretary’s note:  The Chair subsequently pro-
vided approval to the Desk, following the pro-
cedures in the Authori zation for Foreign Cur-
rency Opera tions, to extend the expi ration of 
the tempora ry U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines 
through Decembe r 31, 2021. 
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the inte rmeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 

The information available at the t ime of the June 15–16 
meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product 
(GDP) was expanding in the second quarter at a pace 
that was faster than in the first quarter of the year.  More-
over, labor market condi tions had improved furthe r in 

April and May.  Consumer price in flation through 
April—as measured by the 12-month percentage change 
in the PCE price index—had picked up notably, largely 
reflecting transitory facto rs.  
Total nonfarm payroll employment inc reased solidly 
over April and May, though a t a slower monthly pace 
than over Feb ruary and March.  As of May, total payroll 
employmen t had retraced two-thi rds of the job losses 
seen at the onset of the pandemic, although employm ent 
in the leisure and hospitali ty secto r and in the education 
sector (including both public and private education) had 
bounced back by less.  Over April and May, the unem-
ployment rate edged down and stood at 5.8 percent in 
May.  The unemployment rates fo r African Americans, 
Asians, and Hispanics also moved down, although the 
rates for African Americans and Hispanics remained 
well above the na tional ave rage.  Both the labor force 
participa tion rate and the employment- to-popula tion ra-
tio moved up slightly, and both measures had recovered 
only partially from their lows during the pandemic.  Ini-
tial claims for regular state unemploymen t insurance 
benefits had moved down further since mid-April and 
were at the lowest level since the beginning of the pan-
demic, though they remained high relative to their pre-
pandemic level.  Weekly estimates of private-secto r pay-
rolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using 
data provided by the payroll processor ADP, which were 
available through May, suggested that the pace of private 
employmen t gains had stepped up late in that month. 
The pace of increases in several measures of labor com-
pensation had moved up in recent months.  Average 
hourly earnings for all employees jumped at a sizable 
monthly rate in April and May, even though the large job 
gains in the leisure and hospi tality sec tor—whe re wages 
tend to be lowe r than in o ther sec tors—likely held down 
the increases in ave rage hourly earnings in these months.  
A staff measure of the 12-month change in the median 
wage derived from the ADP data had stepped up signif-
icantly in April relative to March.  The employment cost 
index of total hourly compensation in the private sec tor 
increased at an annual ra te of 4 percent in the three 
months ending in March, a notably faste r pace than over 
the previous three mon ths.   
Recent 12-month change measures of inflation, using ei-
ther PCE pr ices or the consume r price index (CPI ), were 
boosted signi ficantl y by the base effects of the d rop in 
prices from the spring of 2020 rolling out of the calcula-
tion.  In addition, a surge in demand as the economy re-
opened further, combined with produc tion bo ttlenecks 
and supply constraints, con tribu ted to the large recent 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
monthly price inc reases.  Total PCE price inflation was 
3.6 percent over the 12 months ending in April.  Core 
PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in con-
sumer energy prices and many consume r food prices, 
was 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in April.  In 
contras t, the trimmed mean measu re of 12-month PCE 
inflation cons tructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas was 1.8 percent in April.  In May, the 12-month 
change in the CPI was 5 percent, while core CPI infla-
tion was 3.8 percent over the same period.  In the second 
quarter, the staff’s common inflation expec tations index, 
which combines information from many indicators of 
inflation expecta tions and inflation compensa tion, had 
returned to the level that prevailed in 2014, a time when 
inflation was modest. 
Real PCE increased substantially in March and then was 
little changed from that high level in April.  The compo-
nents of the nominal retail sales data that are used to es-
timate PCE edged down in May, but the sales data for 
the previous two months were revised up markedly, 
pointing to stronge r real PCE growth than had been in-
itially estimated.  Combined with reduced social distanc-
ing and more widespread va ccinations, key fac tors that 
influence consume r spending—including inc reasing job 
gains, the upward trend in real disposable income, high 
levels of household net worth, and low interest rates—
pointed to strong real PCE growth over the rest of the 
year.   
Housing demand continued to be robust, with construc-
tion of single-family homes and home sal es remaining 
well above the ir pre-pandemic levels and house p rices 
rising appreciably further.  The incoming data fo r this 
sector indicated that residential inves tment spending was 
being temporaril y held back in the second quarter by ma-
terials shor tages and limited stocks of homes for sale.   
Available indicators suggested that equipmen t and intan-
gibles investmen t—par ticularly in high-tech catego-
ries—was increasing solidly in the second quarter.  Ris-
ing orders fo r nondefense capi tal goods excluding air-
craft were running well above the inc reases in shipm ents 
of those goods through April, which pointed to addi-
tional gains in business equipment spending in coming 
months.  Mo reove r, business investmen t in the drilling 
and mining sector appeared to be increasing further, as 
crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indica tor 
of drilling inves tmen t—con tinued to rise th rough early 
June, with oil price s moving highe r.  However, nominal 
nonresidential construc tion spending declined further in 
April, and investment in nonresiden tial struc tures out-
side of the drilling and mining secto r looked to remain 

weak in the curren t quarter, likely refl ecting continued 
hesitation by businesses to commit to building proj ects 
with lengthy times to comple tion and uncer tain future 
returns.  
Manufacturing output expanded solidly, on balance, 
over April and May.  Output in the motor vehicle and 
parts sec tor rose, on net, although semiconduc tor short-
ages were still weighing on vehicle p roduction.  Factory 
output outside of the moto r vehicle secto r increased sol-
idly, and production in the mining sector, which includes 
crude oil and natural gas extraction, also increased over 
April and May.   
Total real government purchases looked to be about flat, 
on balance, in the second quarter.  Data through May 
indicated that real federal defense spending was rising 
only slightly, and nondefense spending was expected to 
drop following a firs t-quarter surge in pandemic-related 
expenditures.  State and local government purchases 
looked to be increasing significantly, as the payrolls of 
these governm ents expanded solidly over April and May.  
Nominal state and local construction spending, how-
ever, edged down in April.  W ith the strong economic 
recove ry leading to an improved outlook for state and 
local tax revenues, and the addi tional fede ral suppor t for 
these governm ents included in the American Rescue 
Plan, state and local purchases appeared likely to in-
crease notabl y over the res t of the year.  
The nominal U.S. international trad e deficit widened to 
a record size in March and then reversed tha t widening 
in April.  Real goods exports in March surpassed their 
January 2020 levels for the first time and then continued 
to grow in April, with particular strength in exports of 
capital goods.  Real goods imports surged to record-high 
levels in March and then stepped back modestl y in April.  
Bottlenecks in the global semiconduc tor indus try, which 
had weighed on expor ts and impor ts of automo tive 
products thi s year, continued to do so through April.  
Expor ts and impor ts of services remained dep ressed rel-
ative to p re-pandemic levels, as international travel in-
creased only slightly from February. 
Recent data pointed to a pickup in foreign economic ac-
tivity in the second quarter.  Demand improved as  
social-distancing restrictions were lifted in the United 
Kingdom and the euro area following the rollou t of vac-
cines.  W ith the economic reopening under way, pur-
chasing managers indexes (PMIs) in both the manufac-
turing and services sec tors were strong in Europe in 
April and May.  In the emerging market economies 
(EMEs), manufacturing PMIs and exports were gener-

Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
ally robust.  However, many EMEs continued to strug-
gle to contain the vi rus amid a slow pace of vaccinations, 
particularly in South America and parts of Asia.  Con-
sumer price inflation con tinued to ris e in many foreign 
economies, p rimarily driven by rebounding energy 
prices and the fading effects of steep price declines seen 
early last year.  Price inc reases were concen tra ted in rel-
atively few items, suggesting that underlying inflationary 
pressures remained subdued amid considerable eco-
nomic slack. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 

Overall financial conditions eased during the inte rmeet-
ing period as market participan ts appeared to remain 
confiden t that the economic recovery was broadly on 
track, that inflation over the medium term would stay 
contained, and that monetary policy would remain ac-
commodative.  Domes tic equity prices edged up, and 
corpo rate bond sp reads narrowed a little.  Yields on 
nominal Treasury securi ties declined modes tly since the 
previous FOMC meeting.  Measures of infla tion com-
pensation at shor ter hori zons moved down somewhat, 
on net, while measures of longer-term inflation compen-
sation were little changed.  A straight read of overnight 
index swap (OIS) quotes suggested that the expected 
path for the federal funds rate moved lower over the in-
termee ting period and that the expected policy rate 
would remain below 25 basis points until the first quarter 
of 2023.  Short-term funding markets functioned 
smoothly amid record par ticipat ion in the ON RRP fa-
cility.  Financing conditions for businesses and house-
holds remained accommodative, particularly for large 
firms and households with high credit ratings.   
The Treasury yield curve flattened a bit, on net, with  
2-year yields about unchanged while 5-, 10-, and 30-year 
yields declined somewhat.  Inflation compensation de-
clined a bit at shorter ho rizons but held steady at longer 
horizons.  Marke t expec tations for the fede ral funds rate 
path over the medium term, as implied by OIS quotes 
unadjusted for term premiums, declined modera tely. 
Broad stock price ind exes increased slightly over the in-
termee ting period, with stocks in cyclically sensitive sec-
tors generally outperforming.  One-month op tion- 
implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—reached 
its lowest level since February 2020 and remained a bit 
below the middle of its historical distribution.  Spreads 
of yields on co rpo rate bonds ove r those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities narrowed a little for all 
credit ra tings.  Meanwhile, yields on municipal bonds 
reached his torical lows, with spreads roughly unchanged 

for high-credit- rated bonds and moderatel y narrower for 
lower-credit- rated bonds. 
Short-te rm funding markets con tinued to func tion 
smoothly over the in termee ting period. Short-term and 
overnigh t rates remained near his torical lows, with over-
night rates dipping slightly.  The EFFR was nearly con-
stant th roughout the pe riod at 6 basis points, while the 
SOFR remained at 1 basis poin t.  W ith rates low and net 
Treasury bill supply contrac ting, government money 
market funds, which at the same time were attracting no-
table 
inflows, had 
limited 
investment options at 
nonnegative rates.  As a result, ON RRP take-up by 
these funds surged, pushing total ON RRP participation 
to record levels in late May and June.   
Interna tional financial market par ticipants were focused 
on news about inflation and moneta ry policy communi-
cations.  In Europe, stronger- than-expected readings for 
both infla tion and economic activi ty, as well as increased 
optimism about vaccinations, contribu ted to a rise in 
market-based measures of infla tion expecta tions.  On 
net, European longer- term gove rnmen t bond yields 
were little changed even as U.S. yields declined, and the 
broad dollar index dec reased modestl y.  In emerging 
markets, credit spreads narrowed a bit, and capital flows 
into EME funds continued at a moderate pace.  Equity 
indexes increased somewhat in bo th emerging and ad-
vanced foreign economies. 
Financing condi tions fo r nonfinanc ial firms through 
capital markets remained highly accommodative, as re-
flected in his tori cally low corporate bond and leveraged 
loan yields as well as high price-to-earnings ratios in the 
equity markets.  Gross issuance of co rpora te bonds and 
leveraged loans was solid.  Equity raised th rough tradi-
tional init ial public offe rings was robust in Ap ril but sof-
tened to more moderate levels in May and through mid-
June, while the pace of seasoned equity offerings was 
modest over the interm eeting pe riod.  Meanwhile, equity 
issuance through special purpose acquisition companies 
slowed markedly.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) 
loans outstanding at banks fell th rough mid-May, with 
forgiveness of Paycheck Protec tion Program (PPP) 
loans continuing to drive balances down and more than 
offsetting volumes of new loan originations.  Tepid de-
mand for loans appea rs to ha ve been a factor in the de-
cline in loans outstanding.  For instance, despite healthy 
growth in C&I commitments at large banks over the first 
quarter, the re was no corresponding change in the utili-
zation rates of credit lines.  
The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re-
mained largely stable over the in termee ting period.  The

volume of credit rating upgrades for nonfinancial bonds 
and leveraged loans outpaced downgrades somewhat in 
the April-to-early- June period.  There were no reported 
corpo rate defaults in April, and defaults were low in 
May.  Delinquency rates on bank C&I loans also re-
mained low in the first quarter.  Market indicato rs of fu-
ture default expec tations were li ttle changed and re-
mained low relative to their his torical range.   
In the municipal bond market, financing condi tions re-
mained accommodative ove r the intermeeting period.  
Issuance of municipal bonds was solid in recent months, 
and indicato rs of the credi t quality of municipal d ebt 
showed some signs of improvement, with the volume of 
bond upgrades outpac ing the volume of bond down-
grades. 
Financing conditions for small businesses were li ttle 
changed, with supply of small business loans remaining 
tight and demand still subdued outs ide of the PPP.  
While small business loan origina tions rose in April, sur-
passing pre-pandemic levels, loans made under the PPP 
likely accounted for a significant portion of that growth.  
Loan performance and other indicato rs of the financial 
health of small businesses improved in recent months.  
However, in certain sectors, such as accommodation and 
food services, small businesses remained stressed.  
For comme rcial real es tate (CRE) financed through cap-
ital markets, financing conditions remained mostly ac-
commodative ove r the intermeeting period.  Issuance of 
commercial mor tgage-backed securi ties (CMBS) was 
solid in recent months excep t in the retail and hotel sec-
tors.  Spreads of agency CMBS narrowed to below pre-
pandemic levels.  Meanwhil e, spreads on non-agency  
triple-A CMBS were little changed at accommodative 
levels, while non-agency triple-B spreads remained ele-
vated.  CRE loan growth at banks continued to be weak 
through mid-May, likel y reflec ting weak demand as well 
as tight underwriting standards. 
In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions 
were little changed over the inte rmeeting period and re-
mained accommodative for stronge r borrowers who met 
standard confo rming loan cri teria.  Credit con tinued to 
appear tigh t for bo rrowers with lower credi t scores.  
Mortgage rate s for most borrowers were little changed, 
on net, and remained near historical lows.  Home-pur-
chase and refinance mor tgage activi ty con tinued at a 
strong pace through early June.  The share of mortgages 
in forbearance declined in May.   
Financing condi tions fo r consumer cred it remained gen-
erally accommodative.  Consumer loans grew at a robust 

pace in April, driven by rapid growth in auto loan bal-
ances.  Credit card balances on banks’ books rose in 
May, reve rsing an April decline.  Fo r subprime borrow-
ers, conditions in the credi t card market appeared to 
have eased somewhat further from the tight condi tions 
seen after the onset of the pandemi c.  Conditions in the 
asset-backed securi ties market con tinued to be support-
ive of lending during the intermee ting period. 

Staff Economic Outlook 

The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for 
the June FOMC meeting was stronger than the April 
forecast.  Real GDP growth was projec ted to increase 
substantially this year, with a correspondingly rapid de-
cline in the unemployment rate.  Further reductions in 
social distancing and favorab le financial conditions were 
expected to suppo rt output growth, even though the ef-
fects of fiscal stimulus on economic growth were start-
ing to unwind.  W ith the boost to growth from contin-
ued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade af ter 
2021 and the furthe r unwinding of fiscal stimulus, GDP 
growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023.  
Nevertheless, with monetary policy assumed to remain 
highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate 
that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential 
over most of this period, leading to a decline in the un-
employmen t rate to histo rically low levels. 
The staff’s near-term outlook for inflation was revised 
up markedly, but the staff continued to expect the rise 
in inflation this year to be transi tory.  The 12-month 
change in total and co re PCE p rices had moved well 
above 2 percent in Ap ril, and incoming CPI data sug-
gested that PCE price in flation would remain high in 
May.  The recent 12-month measures of infla tion were 
being boosted significantly by the base effects of the 
drop in prices from the spring of 2020 rolling out of the 
calculation.  In addition, the surge in demand as the 
economy reopened furthe r, combined with production 
bottlenecks and supply constraints, contr ibuted to the 
large recent monthly price increases.  The staff expected 
the 12-month change in PCE pr ices to g radually move 
down in coming months, reflecting, importantly, the 
fading of base effec ts along with small er expected 
monthly pri ce increases, but PCE price inflat ion was 
forecast to still be well above 2 percent at the end o f this 
year.  Over the next yea r, the transi tory p rice increases 
caused by bottlenecks and supply constraints were ex-
pected to largely reverse, and the growth in demand was 
forecast to ease.  As a result, inflation was projected to 
slow to slightly below 2 percent in 2022 before moving 
back up to a bit above 2 percent in 2023, supported by 
high levels of resource utiliza tion.

The staff continued to see the uncertainty surrounding 
the economi c outlook as elevated, although inc reasingly 
widespread vaccina tions, along with ongoing policy sup-
port, were viewed as helping to diminish some of these 
uncertain ties.  Nevertheless, the staff judged that the 
risks around their strong baseline projec tion for eco-
nomic activi ty were still ti lted somewhat to the down-
side, as adverse alternative courses of the pandemic—
including the possibili ty of the spread of more- conta-
gious, more-vaccine-resis tant COVID-19 va riants—
seemed more likely than outcom es that would be more 
favorable than in the baseline forecast.  The staff contin-
ued to view the risks around the infla tion proj ection as 
roughly balanced.  On the upside, bottlenecks, supply 
disruptions, and histo rically high rates of resource utili-
zation were seen as potential source s of greate r-than- 
expected in flationa ry pre ssures, parti cularly if there were 
a significant rise in inflation expectations that alte red in-
flation dynamics.  On the downside, if the effects of sup-
ply constraints proved to be transitory, as expec ted, then 
the inflation record from the past 25 years suggested the 
possibility that low underlying trend infla tion and a flat 
Phillips curve could cause inflation to revert to relatively 
low levels despite a strengthening economy. 

Participants’ Views on Current Economic Condi-
tions and the Economic Outlook 

In conjunction with this FOMC meet ing, participants 
submitted their p rojec tions of the mos t likely ou tcomes 
for real GDP g rowth, the unemploym ent rate, and infla-
tion for each year from 2021 th rough 2023 and over the 
longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap-
propria te mone tary policy, including the path o f the fed-
eral funds rate.  The longe r-run p rojec tions represented 
each participant’s assessmen t of the rate to which each 
variable would be expected to conve rge, over time, un-
der appropria te moneta ry policy and in the absence of 
further shocks to the economy.  A Summary of Eco-
nomic Pro jections was released to the public following 
the conclusion of the meeting. 
In their discussion of current condi tions, participants 
noted tha t progress on vaccinations had reduced the 
spread of COVID-19 in the United States.  Amid this 
progress and strong policy support, indicators of eco-
nomic activity and employment had strengthened.  The 
sectors mos t adversely affec ted by the pandemic re-
mained weak but had shown improvement.  Inflation 
had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors.  Overall 
financial conditions remained accommodative, in part 
reflecting policy measures to suppo rt the economy and 
the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.  

Participants generall y noted tha t the path of the econ-
omy would depend significantly on the course of the vi-
rus.  Progress on vaccina tions would likely continue to 
reduce the effec ts of the public heal th crisis on the econ-
omy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. 
Participants obse rved tha t economic activity was ex-
panding at a historicall y rapid pace, led by robust gains 
in consumer spending.  A vast majority of participants 
revised up their projections for real GDP growth this 
year compared with the projec tions they had submitted 
in March, ci ting stronger consumer demand and im-
provements in vacc ination rates as the primary reasons 
for these upgrades.  That said, participants generally saw 
supply disruptions and labo r shor tages as cons training 
the expansion of economic activity this year.  Partici-
pants’ projections of real GDP growth in 2022 and 2023 
were generally little changed. 
In their discussion of the household secto r, participants 
remarked that indica tors of consumer spending had con-
tinued to surge and expected that further gains in spend-
ing would contribute significantly to the economic re-
covery.  Many participants commented tha t accommo-
dative financial conditions, the release of pent-up de-
mand, progress on widespread vacc ination, the ongoing 
reduction of social-distancing measures, and fiscal stim-
ulus were important factors supporting spending.  Some 
participants also noted that consumer spending would 
likely continue to be bolstered by the ongoing effects 
from thes e facto rs as well as by households’ elevated 
level of accumulated savings and generally healthy bal-
ance sheets.  A majority of participants observed that 
housing market activi ty remained strong. 
W ith respect to the business sector, most participants 
noted that ac tivity in the servi ce industries most ad-
versely affec ted by the pandemic, such as in the leisure 
and hospitali ty sec tor, was rebounding as the economy 
reopened.  A number of participants noted that business 
equipment inves tment was rising at a strong pace, but 
growth in manufacturing activi ty was being restrained by 
production bottlenecks and supply constrain ts.  In addi-
tion, participan ts repor ted hearing from contacts in a 
broad range of industries that shortages of materials and 
labor as well as supply chain chall enges were limiting the 
ability of firms to keep up with demand.  Some business 
contac ts indicated that they were responding to input 
shortages and bottlenecks by canceling shifts, raising 
compensation to attrac t and retain workers, raising 
prices, or focusing on cutting cos ts and increasing 
productiv ity, parti cularly through automation.

Participants commented on the continued imp rovem ent 
in labor market conditions in recent months.  Job gains 
in April and May averaged mo re than 400,000, and the 
unemploymen t rate edged down, on net, to 5.8 percent 
over the period.  Many participants pointed to the ele-
vated number of job openings and high rates of job 
switching as furthe r evidence of the improvement in la-
bor market conditions.  Many participants remarked, 
however, that the economy was still far from achieving 
the Committee’s broad-based and inclusive maximum-
employmen t goal, and some participants indicated that 
recent job gains, while strong, were weaker than they had 
expected.  A number of participants noted that the labor 
market recovery continued to be uneven across demo-
graphic and income groups and across sectors. 
Participants noted tha t their Distric t contacts had re-
ported having troubl e hiring workers to meet demand, 
likely reflect ing factors such as early retiremen ts, con-
cerns about the virus, childcare responsibilities, and ex-
panded unemploymen t insurance benefits.  Some partic-
ipants remarked that these factors were making people 
either less able or less inclined to work in the current 
environment.  Citing recen t wage data and reports from 
business contacts, many participan ts judged that labor 
shortages were putting upward pressure on wages or 
leading employers to provide additional financial incen-
tives to attract and retain wo rkers, pa rticular ly in lower-
wage occupations.  Parti cipants expected labor market 
conditions to continue to improve, with labor sho rtages 
expected to ease th roughout the summer and into the 
fall as progress on vaccinations continues, social distanc-
ing unwinds further, more schools reopen, and ex-
panded unemploymen t insurance benefi ts expire. 
In their discussions on inflation, part icipan ts stated that 
they had expected inflation to move above 2 percent in 
the near te rm, in part as the drop in pri ces from early in 
the pandemic fell out of the calculation and past in-
creases in oil prices passed through to consume r energy 
prices.  However, pa rticipants remarked that the actual 
rise in inflat ion was larger than anti cipated, with the  
12-month change in the PCE price index reaching 
3.6 percen t in April.  Participan ts attributed the upside 
surprise to more widespread supply constraints in prod-
uct and labor markets than they had anticipated and to a 
larger-than-expected surge in consumer demand as the 
economy reopened.  They noted that many of their Dis-
trict con tacts had repo rted tha t higher input costs were 
putting upward pressure on prices.  Most participants 
observed tha t the largest contribu tors to the rise in meas-
ured inflation were sectors affec ted by supply bottle-
necks or sectors where price levels were rebounding 

from levels depressed by the pandemic.  Looking ahead, 
participants generally expec ted inflation to ease as the 
effect of these transitory facto rs dissipated, but several 
participants remarked tha t they anti cipated that supply 
chain limitations and input shortages would put upward 
pressure on p rices into next yea r.  Several participants 
noted that, during the early months of the reopening, 
uncertain ty remained too high to accurate ly assess how 
long inflation p ressures will be sustained.  Some partici-
pants commen ted tha t recen t readings of infla tion 
measures that ex clude volatil e components, such as 
trimmed mean measures, had been relatively stable at or 
just below 2 percent.  In their comments on longer- term 
inflation expectations, a number of participan ts noted 
that, despite increases ea rlier this year, measures of 
longer-te rm inflation expecta tions had remained in 
ranges tha t were broadly consis ten t with the Commit-
tee’s longer-run in flation goal.  Others no ted tha t it was 
this year’s increases that had brought these measures to 
levels that were b roadly cons isten t with the Commi ttee’s 
longer-run inflation goal.  
Participants no ted that overall financial condi tions re-
mained highly accommoda tive, in pa rt re flecting the 
stance of monetary policy, which continued to deliver 
approp riate support to the economy.  Several partici-
pants highlighted, howeve r, that low interest rates were 
contributing to el evated house prices and that valuation 
pressures in housing markets might pos e financial stabil-
ity risks. 
In discussing the uncer tainty and risks associa ted with 
the economi c outlook, participants commen ted tha t the 
process of reopening the economy was unprecedented 
and likely to be uneven across sectors.  Some partici-
pants judged that supply chain disruptions and labor 
shortages comp licated the task of assessing progress to-
ward the Committee’s goals and that the speed at which 
these factors would dissipate was uncer tain.  Accord-
ingly, participan ts judged that unce rtain ty around their 
economic proj ections was elevated.  Although they gen-
erally saw the risks to the outlook fo r economic activity 
as broadly balanced, a substantial majority of partici-
pants judged that the risks to their inflation projec tions 
were tilted to the upside because of concerns that supply 
disruptions and labor sho rtages might linger for longer 
and might have larger or more persisten t effects on 
prices and wages than they curren tly assumed.  Several 
participants express ed concern tha t longer-te rm infla-
tion expec tations might rise to inappropriate levels if el-
evated inflation readings persisted.  Several other partic-
ipants cautioned tha t downside risks to inflat ion re-

mained because temporary p rice p ressures might un-
wind faster than currently an ticipa ted and because the 
forces tha t held down inflation and inflation expecta-
tions during the previous economic expansion had not 
gone away or might reinforce the effect of the unwind-
ing of temporary price pressures. 
In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, 
participants reaf firmed the Fed eral Reserve’s commit-
ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. 
economy during this challenging time, thereby promot-
ing the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum em-
ployment and p rice stabili ty.  Parti cipan ts generally 
agreed that the economic recove ry was incomplete and 
that risks to the economic outlook remained.  Although 
inflation had risen more than anticipated, the increase 
was seen as largely reflecting tempo rary fac tors, and par-
ticipants expected inflation to decline toward the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent longer- run objective.   
Participants judged that the current stance of mone tary 
policy and policy guidance remained appropriate to pro-
mote maximum employmen t as well as to achieve infla-
tion that averages 2 percent ove r time and longer-term 
inflation expectations tha t are well anchored at 2 per-
cent.  Participants also rei tera ted that the existing out-
come-based guidance implied that the paths of the fed-
eral funds rate and the balance shee t would depend on 
actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maxi-
mum-employment and inflation goals.  In light of the 
incoming data and the implications for their economic 
outlooks, a few participants mentioned that they ex-
pected the economic condi tions se t out in the Commit-
tee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate to be 
met somewhat earlier than they had projected in March.  
Several participan ts emphasized, however, that uncer-
tainty around the economic outlook was elevated and 
that it was too early to draw firm conclusions about the 
paths of the labor market and inflation.  In their view, 
this heightened uncertain ty regarding the evolution of 
the economy also implied significant uncertainty about 
the approp riate path of the federal funds rate.  Some par-
ticipants noted that communications about the appro-
priate path of policy would be a focus of market partici-
pants in the curren t envi ronment and commented that it 
would be important to emphasize that the Committee’s 
reaction function or commitment to its moneta ry policy 
framework had not changed.   
Participants discussed the Federal Reserve’s asset pur-
chases and progress toward the Committee’s goals since 
last December when the Committee adopted its guid-
ance for asset purchases.  The Committee’s standard of 

“substantial furthe r progress” was generally seen as not 
having yet been met, though participan ts expected pro-
gress to continue.  Various participants mentioned that 
they expec ted the conditions for beginning to reduce the 
pace of asset purchases to be met somewhat earlier than 
they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of in-
coming data.  Some participants saw the incoming data 
as providing a less clear signal about the underlying eco-
nomic momentum and judged that the Committee 
would have information in coming months to make a 
bette r assessment of the path of the labor market and 
inflation.  As a result, several of these participants em-
phasized tha t the Commi ttee should be patien t in as-
sessing progress toward its goals and in announcing 
changes to its plans for asse t purchase s.  Participants 
generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it 
was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace 
of asset purchas es, if approp riate, in respons e to unex-
pected economic developmen ts, including faste r-than-
anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or 
the emergence of risks that could impede the a ttainm ent 
of the Committee’s goals.   
Various participants of fered their views on the Commit-
tee’s agency MBS purchases.  Several participants saw 
benefits to reducing the pace of thes e purchases more 
quickly or earlier than Treasury purchases in light of val-
uation pressure s in housing marke ts.  Several other par-
ticipants, however, commented that reducing the pace 
of Treasury and MBS purchases commensurately was 
preferab le because this approa ch would be well aligned 
with the Committee’s previous communications or be-
cause purchases of Treasury securities and MBS both 
provide accommodation th rough their influence on 
broader financial conditions.  In coming meetings, par-
ticipants agreed to con tinue assessing the economy’s 
progress toward the Committee’s goals and to begin to 
discuss their plans fo r adjusting the pa th and composi-
tion of asset purchases.  In addition, participants reiter-
ated their in ten tion to p rovide no tice well in advance of 
an announcement to reduce the pace of purchases.   
W ith regard to the implementation of moneta ry policy, 
participants had observed downward pressure on money 
market rates over the inte rmeeting period and viewed 
the possibility of further downward pressure on these 
rates in the near term as likely.  Consequently, they noted 
that an adjustment to the Federal Reserve’s administered 
rates would help keep the federal funds rate well within 
the targe t range and suppo rt smoo th market func tioning 
of short-term funding markets.  Par ticipan ts agreed that

this techn ical adjustment had no bearing on the appro-
priate path for the federal funds rate or the stance of 
monetary poli cy.   

Committee Policy Action 

In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members agreed tha t progress on vaccina tions had re-
duced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States.  
They noted tha t amid prog ress and strong policy sup-
port, indicators of economic act ivity and employm ent 
had streng thened.  Although the secto rs most adve rsely 
affected by the pand emic remained weak, they had 
shown improvem ent.  Inflation had risen, largely re flect-
ing transitory facto rs.  Overall financial conditions re-
mained accommodative, 
in par t reflec ting policy 
measures to support the economy and the flow of credit 
to U.S. households and businesses.  Members also 
agreed that the pa th of the economy would depend sig-
nificantly on the course of the vi rus.  Progress on vac-
cinations would likely con tinue to reduce the effects of 
the public heal th crisis on the economy, but risks to the 
economic outlook remained. 
Members agreed tha t the Fede ral Reserve was commit-
ted to using its full range of tools to suppo rt the U.S. 
economy in this challenging time, the reby promoting its 
maximum-employment and price-s tability goals.  All 
members reaffirmed tha t, in accordance with the Com-
mittee’s goals to achieve maximum employmen t and in-
flation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and 
with inflation having run persis tentl y below thi s longer-
run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately 
above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 
2 percen t over time and longe r-te rm inflation expecta-
tions remain well anchored at 2 pe rcen t.  Members ex-
pected to main tain an accommodative stance of mone-
tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. 
All members agreed to keep the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that 
it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un-
til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent 
with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employ-
ment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on 
track to mod eratel y exceed 2 percent fo r some time.  In 
addition, members agreed that it would be appropriate 
for the Fede ral Reserve to continue to increase its hold-
ings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per 
month and agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month 
until substantial furthe r progress had been made toward 
the Committee’s maximum-employmen t and price-sta-
bility goals.  They judged that these asset purchases 

would help foster smooth market functioning and ac-
commodative financial condi tions, thereby supporting 
the flow of credit to households and businesses. 
Members agreed tha t, in assessing the appropria te stance 
of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the 
implications of incoming information for the economic 
outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the 
stance of moneta ry policy as approp riate in the event 
that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of 
the Committee’s goals.  Members also concurred that, in 
assessing the appropria te stance of moneta ry policy, they 
would take into accoun t a wide range of info rmation, in-
cluding readings on public health, labor market condi-
tions, inflation pressures and inflation expec tations, and 
financial and interna tional developments. 
Members judged that the economic outlook had contin-
ued to improve and that the most negative effects of the 
pandemic on the economy mos t likely had occurred.  As 
a result, they agreed to remove references in the FOMC 
statemen t that noted tha t the vi rus was “causing tremen-
dous human and economic hardship” and tha t “the on-
going public health crisis continues to weigh on the 
economy.”  Instead, they agreed to say that progress on 
vaccinations had reduced the sp read of COVID-19 and 
would likely continue to reduce the negative economic 
effects of the public health crisis.   
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authori ze and direct the Federal Reserve Bank

The vote also encompassed approval of the statem ent 
below for release at 2:00 p.m.: 
“The Federal Reserve is committed to using its 
full range of tools to suppo rt the U.S.  economy 
in this challenging time, thereby promoting its 
maximum employment and p rice s tability goals. 
Progress on vaccinations has reduced the 
spread of COVID-19 in the United States.  
Amid this progress and strong policy support, 
indicators of economic activity and employ-
ment have strengthened.  The sectors most ad-
versely affec ted by the pandemic remain weak 
but have shown improvemen t.  Inflation has 
risen, largely reflecting transitory factors.  Over-
all financial conditions remain accommodative, 
in part refl ecting policy measures to suppor t the 
economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house-
holds and businesses. 
The path of the economy will depend signifi-
cantly on the course of the virus.  Progress on 
vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the 
effects of the public health crisis on the econ-
omy, but risks to the economic outlook remain. 

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em-
ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent 
over the longer run.  W ith inflation having run 
persistently below this longer-run goal, the 
Committee will aim to achieve inflation moder-
ately above 2 percen t for some time so that in-
flation averages 2 percent over 
time and 
longer‑ term inflation expec tations remain well 
anchored at 2 percen t.  The Committee expects 
to maintain an accommodative stance of mone-
tary policy until thes e outcomes are achieved.  
The Committee decided to keep the target range 
for the fede ral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
expects it will be appropriate to maintain this 
target range until labor market condi tions have 
reached levels consis ten t with the Committee’s 
assessments of maximum employment and in-
flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to 
moderately exceed 2 percen t for some time.  In 
addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to 
increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at 
least $80 billion per month and of agency mort-
gage‑backed securi ties by at l east $40 billion per 
month until substan tial furthe r progress has 
been made toward the Committee’s maximum 
employmen t and price stability goals.  These as-
set purchases help foste r smooth market func-
tioning and accommoda tive financial condi-
tions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to 
households and businesses. 
In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary 
policy, the Committee will cont inue to moni tor 
the implications of incoming informa tion for 
the economic outlook.  The Committee would 
be prepared to adjust the stance of mone tary 
policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could 
impede the a ttainment of the Commi ttee’s 
goals.  The Committee’s assessments will take 
into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding readings on publi c health, labor market 
conditions, inflation pressu res and infla tion ex-
pectations, and financial and international de-
velopmen ts.” 
Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
W illiams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W . Bostic, Michelle 
W . Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. 
Daly, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. Quarles, and 
Christopher J. Waller.

Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
Consisten t with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the in-
teres t rates on required and excess reserve balances to 
0.15 percent.  Setting the interest rate paid on required 
and excess reserve balances 15 basis points above the 
bottom of the target range for the fede ral funds rate is 
intended to foster trading in the fede ral funds market at 
rates well within the Federal Open Market Commi ttee’s 
target range and to support the smooth functioning of 
short- term funding markets.  The Board of Governors 
also voted unanimously to approve establishmen t of the 
primary credit ra te at the exist ing level o f 0.25 percent, 
effective June 17, 2021. 

It was agreed that the next mee ting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 27–
28, 2021.  The meeting adjourned at 10:40 a.m. on 
June 16, 2021.
