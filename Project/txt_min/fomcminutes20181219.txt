Long-Run Monetary Policy 
Frameworks 

Implementation 

Committee participants resumed their discussion from 
the November 2018 FOMC meeting of potential long-
run frameworks for monetary policy implementation.  
At the December meeting, the staff provided a set of 
briefings that considered various issues related to the 
transition to a long-run operating regime with lower lev-
els of excess reserves than at present and to a long-run 
composition of the balance sheet.   
The staff noted that during the transition to a long-run 
operating regime with excess reserves below current lev-
els, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) could begin 
to rise a little above the interest on excess reserves 
(IOER) rate as reserves in the banking system declined 
gradually to a level that the Committee judges to be most 
appropriate for efficient and effective implementation of 
policy.  This upward movement in the federal funds rate

could be gradual.  However, the staff noted that the fed-
eral funds rate and other money market rates could pos-
sibly become somewhat volatile at times as banks and 
financial markets adjusted to lower levels of reserve bal-
ances.  Were upward pressures on the federal funds rate 
to emerge, it could be challenging to distinguish between 
pressures that were transitory and likely to abate as fi-
nancial institutions adjust and those that were more per-
sistent and associated with aggregate reserve scarcity.  
The staff reported on the monitoring of conditions in 
money markets as well as various survey and market out-
reach activities that could assist in detecting reserve scar-
city.  The staff reviewed a number of steps that the Fed-
eral Reserve could take to ensure effective monetary pol-
icy implementation were upward pressures on the fed-
eral funds rate and other money market rates to emerge.  
These steps included lowering the IOER rate further 
within the target range, using the discount window to 
support the efficient distribution of reserves, and slow-
ing or smoothing the pace of reserve decline through 
open market operations or through slowing portfolio re-
demptions.  The staff also discussed new ceiling tools 
that could help keep the EFFR within the Committee’s 
target range, including options that would add new 
counterparties for the Open Market Desk’s operations.  
The staff also provided a review of the liabilities on the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet; the review described the 
factors that influence the size of reserve and nonreserve 
liabilities and discussed the increase in the size of these 
liabilities since the financial crisis.  Additionally, the staff 
outlined various issues related to the long-run composi-
tion of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) port-
folio, including the maturity composition of the portfo-
lio’s Treasury securities and the management of residual 
holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
after the Committee has normalized the size of the bal-
ance sheet.   
In discussing the transition to a long-run operating re-
gime, participants commented on the advantages and 
disadvantages of allowing reserves to decline to a level 
that could put noticeable upward pressure on the federal 
funds rate, at least for a time.  Reducing reserves close 
to the lowest level that still corresponded to the flat por-
tion of the reserve demand curve would be one ap-
proach consistent with the Committee’s previously 
stated intention, in the Policy Normalization Principles 
and Plans that it issued in 2014, to “hold no more secu-
rities than necessary to implement monetary policy effi-
ciently and effectively.”  However, reducing reserves to 
a point very close to the level at which the reserve de-

mand curve begins to slope upward could lead to a sig-
nificant increase in the volatility in short-term interest 
rates and require frequent sizable open market opera-
tions or new ceiling facilities to maintain effective inter-
est rate control.  These considerations suggested that it 
might be appropriate to instead provide a buffer of re-
serves sufficient to ensure that the Federal Reserve op-
erates consistently on the flat portion of the reserve de-
mand curve so as to promote the efficient and effective 
implementation of monetary policy. 
Participants discussed options for maintaining control of 
interest rates should upward pressures on money market 
rates emerge during the transition to a regime with lower 
excess reserves.  Several participants commented on op-
tions that rely on existing or currently used tools, such 
as further technical adjustments to the IOER rate to 
keep the federal funds rate within the target range or us-
ing the discount window, although such options were 
recognized to have limitations in some situations.  Some 
participants commented on the possibility of slowing the 
pace of the decline in reserves in approaching the longer-
run level of reserves.  Standard temporary open market 
operations could be used for this purpose. In addition, 
participants discussed options such as ending portfolio 
redemptions with a relatively high level of reserves still 
in the system and then either maintaining that level of 
reserves or allowing growth in nonreserve liabilities to 
very gradually reduce reserves further.  These ap-
proaches could allow markets and banks more time to 
adjust to lower reserve levels while maintaining effective 
control of interest rates.  Several participants, however, 
expressed concern that a slowing of redemptions could 
be misinterpreted as a signal about the stance of mone-
tary policy.  Some participants expressed an interest in 
learning more about possible options for new ceiling 
tools to provide firmer control of the policy rate.   
Participants commented on the role that the Federal Re-
serve’s nonreserve liabilities have played in the expan-
sion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet since the fi-
nancial crisis.  Many participants noted that the magni-
tudes of these nonreserve liabilities—most significantly 
currency but also liabilities to the Treasury through the 
Treasury General Account and liabilities to foreign offi-
cial institutions through their accounts at the Federal Re-
serve—are not closely related to Federal Reserve mone-
tary policy decisions.  They also remarked that the size 
of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was expected to 
increase over time as the growth of these liabilities 
roughly tracks the growth of nominal gross domestic 
product (GDP).  Additionally, participants cited the so-
cial benefits provided by these liabilities to the economy.

Participants considered it important to present infor-
mation on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to the 
public in ways that communicated these facts.  In dis-
cussing the long-run level of reserve liabilities, partici-
pants noted that it might be useful to explore ways to 
encourage banks to reduce their demand for reserves 
and to provide information to banks and the public 
about the likely long-run level of reserves.   
Participants commented on a number of issues related 
to the long-run composition of the SOMA portfolio.  
With regard to the portfolio of Treasury securities, par-
ticipants discussed the advantages of different portfolio 
maturity compositions.  Several participants noted that a 
portfolio of holdings weighted toward shorter maturities 
would provide greater flexibility to lengthen maturity if 
warranted by an economic downturn, while a couple of 
others noted that a portfolio with maturities that 
matched the outstanding Treasury market would have a 
more neutral effect on the market.  With regard to the 
MBS portfolio, participants noted that the passive run-
off of MBS holdings through principal paydowns would 
continue for many years after the size of the balance 
sheet had been normalized.  Several participants com-
mented on the possibility of reducing agency MBS hold-
ings somewhat more quickly than the passive approach 
by implementing a program of very gradual MBS sales 
sometime after the size of the balance sheet had been 
normalized. 
Participants expected to continue their discussion of 
long-run implementation frameworks and related issues 
at upcoming meetings.  They reiterated the importance 
of communicating clearly on the rationale for any deci-
sion made on the implementation framework. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 

The SOMA manager reviewed developments in financial 
markets over the intermeeting period.  Asset prices were 
volatile in recent weeks, reportedly reflecting a pullback 
from risk-taking by investors.  In part, the deterioration 
in risk sentiment appeared to stem importantly from un-
certainty about the state of trade negotiations between 
China and the United States.  In addition, investors 
pointed to concerns about the global growth outlook, 
the unsettled state of Brexit negotiations, and uncertain-
ties about the political situation in Europe.  
Against this backdrop, U.S. stock prices were down 
nearly 8 percent on the period.  Risk spreads on corpo-
rate bonds widened appreciably, with market partici-
pants reportedly focusing on the potential implications 
of downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook for the 

financial condition of companies, particularly for com-
panies at the lower end of the investment-grade spec-
trum.  Treasury yields declined significantly, especially at 
longer maturities, contributing to some flattening of the 
Treasury yield curve.  Based on readings from Treasury 
Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), the decline in 
nominal Treasury yields was associated with a notable 
drop in inflation compensation.  A sizable decline in oil 
prices was cited as an important factor contributing to 
the drop in measures of inflation compensation. 
The deterioration in market sentiment was accompanied 
by a significant downward revision in the expected path 
of the federal funds rate based on federal funds futures 
quotes.  In addition, futures-based measures of policy 
expectations moved lower in response to speeches by 
Federal Reserve officials.  The revision in the expected 
policy path was less noticeable in the Desk’s survey-
based measures of the expected path of the federal funds 
rate.  Desk surveys indicated that respondents placed 
high odds on a further quarter-point firming in the 
stance of monetary policy at the December meeting, but 
lower than the near certainty of a rate increase reported 
just before previous policy firmings in 2018; survey re-
sponses anticipated that the median projected path of 
the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Pro-
jections (SEP) would show only two additional quarter-
point policy firmings next year—down from the three 
policy firmings in the median path in the September SEP 
results. 
The deputy manager followed with a discussion of 
money market developments and open market opera-
tions.  After a fast narrowing of the spread between the 
IOER rate and the EFFR before the November meet-
ing, the EFFR had remained stable at, or just 1 basis 
point below the level of the IOER rate since then.  Some 
upward pressures on overnight rates were evident in the 
repurchase agreement (repo) market, apparently from 
higher issuance of Treasury bills and an associated ex-
pansion of primary dealer inventories over the inter-
meeting period.  Banks expanded their lending in repo 
markets in light of higher repo rates relative to the IOER 
rate; the willingness of banks to lend in repo markets 
suggested that the reserve supply was still ample.  The 
deputy manager noted the results of the recent Desk sur-
veys of primary dealers and market participants indicat-
ing an increase in the median respondent’s estimate of 
the long-run level of reserve balances to a level closer to 
that implied by banks’ responses in the Senior Financial 
Officer Survey conducted in advance of the November 
FOMC meeting.  The deputy manager also reported on 
paydowns on the SOMA securities holdings.  Under the 

Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
baseline outlook, prepayments of principal on agency 
MBS would remain below the $20 billion redemption 
cap for the foreseeable future.  However, if longer-term 
interest rates moved substantively lower than assumed 
in the baseline, some modest reinvestments in MBS 
could occur for a few months next year concurrent with 
the pickup in seasonal turnover.   
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 

The information reviewed for the December 18–19 
meeting indicated that labor market conditions contin-
ued to strengthen in recent months and that real GDP 
growth was strong.  Consumer price inflation, as meas-
ured by the 12-month percentage change in the price in-
dex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 
2 percent in October.  Survey-based measures of longer-
run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. 
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in 
November, and job gains were strong, on average, over 
recent months.  The national unemployment rate re-
mained at a very low level of 3.7 percent, and both the 
labor force participation rate and the employment-to-
population ratio also stayed flat in November.  The un-
employment rates for African Americans, Asians, and 
Hispanics in November were below their levels at the 
end of the previous economic expansion.  The share of 
workers employed part time for economic reasons was 
still close to the lows reached in late 2007.  The rates of 
private-sector job openings and quits were both still at 
high levels in October; initial claims for unemployment 
insurance benefits in early December were still close to 
historically low levels.  Total labor compensation per 
hour in the nonfarm business sector—a volatile measure 
even on a four-quarter change basis—increased 2.2 per-
cent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter.  
Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.1 per-
cent over the 12 months ending in November. 
Industrial production expanded, on net, over October 
and November.  Output increased in the mining and util-
ities sectors, while manufacturing production edged 
down on balance.  Automakers’ assembly schedules sug-
gested that production of light motor vehicles would rise 
in December, and new orders indexes from national and 
regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate 
gains in total factory output in the coming months. 

Household spending continued to increase at a strong 
pace in recent months.  Real PCE growth was brisk in 
October, and the components of the nominal retail sales 
used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct 
its estimate of PCE rose considerably in November.  
The pace of light motor vehicle sales edged down in No-
vember but stayed near its recent elevated level.  Key 
factors that influence consumer spending—including 
ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and the 
effects of earlier increases in equity prices and home val-
ues on households’ net worth—continued to be sup-
portive of solid real PCE growth in the near term.  Con-
sumer sentiment, as measured by the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained relatively up-
beat through early December. 
Real residential investment appeared to be declining fur-
ther in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part the ef-
fects of the rise in mortgage interest rates over the past 
year on the affordability of housing.  Starts of new sin-
gle-family homes decreased in October and November, 
although starts of multifamily units rose sharply in No-
vember.  Building permit issuance for new single-family 
homes, which tends to be a good indicator of the under-
lying trend in construction of such homes, moved down 
modestly over recent months.  Sales of new homes de-
clined markedly in October, although existing home 
sales increased modestly. 
Growth in real private expenditures for business equip-
ment and intellectual property looked to be picking up 
solidly in the fourth quarter after moderating in the pre-
vious quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft moved up 
in October.   
Forward-looking 
indicators of business equipment 
spending—such as a rising backlog of unfilled orders for 
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and upbeat 
readings on business sentiment—pointed to further 
spending gains in the near term.  Nominal business ex-
penditures for nonresidential structures outside of the 
drilling and mining sector declined modestly in October, 
while the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in op-
eration—an indicator of business spending for struc-
tures in the drilling and mining sector—held about 
steady in November through early December. 
Total real government purchases appeared to be rising 
moderately in the fourth quarter.  Nominal defense 
spending in October and November pointed to solid 
growth in real federal purchases.  Real purchases by state 
and local governments looked to be only edging up, as 
nominal construction spending by these governments 

Minutes of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
rose solidly in October but their payrolls declined a little 
in October and November. 
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened 
slightly in October.  Exports declined a little, with de-
creases in exports of agricultural products and capital 
goods, although exports of industrial supplies increased.  
Imports rose a bit, with increases in imports of con-
sumer goods and automotive products, but imports of 
capital goods declined sharply from September’s ele-
vated level.  Available trade data suggested that the con-
tribution of the change in net exports to the rate of real 
GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less 
negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in 
the third quarter.  
Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 2 percent over the 12 months end-
ing in October.  Core PCE price inflation, which ex-
cludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 
1.8 percent over that same period.  The consumer price 
index (CPI) rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending 
in November, and core CPI inflation was also 2.2 per-
cent.  Recent readings on survey-based measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations—including those from 
the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Fore-
casters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and 
Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on 
balance. 
Foreign economic growth continued at a moderate pace 
in the third quarter, as a pickup in emerging market 
economies (EMEs) roughly offset slowing growth in ad-
vanced foreign economies (AFEs).  Among EMEs, 
growth in Mexico and Brazil bounced back from transi-
tory second-quarter weakness, more than offsetting a 
slowdown in China and India.  The softness in AFE 
growth partly reflected temporary factors, including dis-
ruptions from natural disasters in Japan and the adop-
tion of new car emissions testing in Germany.  Indica-
tors for economic activity in the fourth quarter were 
consistent with continued moderate foreign economic 
growth.  Foreign inflation fell in recent months, largely 
reflecting a significant drag from lower oil prices.  Un-
derlying inflation pressures, especially in some AFEs, re-
mained muted. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 

Investors’ perceptions of downside risks to the domestic 
and global outlook appeared to increase over the inter-
meeting period, reportedly driven in part by signs of 
slowing in foreign economies and growing concerns 
over escalating trade frictions.  Both nominal U.S. Treas-
ury yields and U.S. equity prices declined notably over 

the period.  Financing conditions for businesses and 
households tightened a bit but generally remained sup-
portive of economic growth. 
Remarks by Federal Reserve officials over the intermeet-
ing period were interpreted by market participants as sig-
naling a shift in the stance of policy toward a more grad-
ual path of federal funds rate increases.  The market- 
implied path for the federal funds rate for 2019 and 2020 
shifted down markedly, while the market-implied prob-
ability for a rate hike at the December FOMC meeting 
declined slightly though remained high.   
Nominal Treasury yields fell considerably over the pe-
riod, with the declines most pronounced in longer-dated 
maturities and contributing to a flattening of the yield 
curve.  The spread between 10- and 2-year nominal 
Treasury yields narrowed to near the 20th percentile of 
its distribution since 1971.  Investor perceptions of in-
creased downside risks to the outlooks for domestic and 
foreign economic growth, including growing concerns 
over trade frictions between the United States and 
China, reportedly weighed on yields.  Measures of infla-
tion compensation derived from TIPS also decreased 
notably over the period along with the declines in oil 
prices. 
Concerns over escalating trade tensions, global growth 
prospects, and the sustainability of corporate earnings 
growth were among the factors that appeared to contrib-
ute to a significant drop in U.S. equity prices.  The de-
clines were largest in the technology and retail sectors.  
One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 in-
dex—the VIX—increased over the period and corpo-
rate credit spreads widened, consistent with the selloff in 
equities.  
Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets 
were affected by perceived increases in downside risks 
to the global growth outlook and ongoing uncertainty 
about trade relations between the United States and 
China.  Investors also focused on the state of negotia-
tions over Brexit and the Italian government budget def-
icit.  Equity markets in AFEs posted notable declines, 
and Europe-dedicated bond and equity funds reported 
strong outflows.  Equity declines in EMEs were more 
modest, and emerging market funds received modest in-
flows on net. 
AFE sovereign yields declined significantly, reflecting 
decreases in U.S. bond yields and weaker-than-expected 
euro-area and U.K. economic data.  Measures of infla-
tion compensation generally fell, partly reflecting sharp 
decreases in oil prices.  Spreads of Italian sovereign 

Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
yields over German counterparts narrowed amid pro-
gress on budget negotiations between the Italian govern-
ment and the European Commission.  The U.S. dollar 
appreciated modestly; although declines in U.S. yields 
weighed on the dollar, deteriorating global risk senti-
ment provided support.  Ongoing uncertainty about the 
passage of a Brexit withdrawal agreement put downward 
pressure on the exchange value of the British pound. 
Short-term funding markets functioned smoothly over 
the intermeeting period.  Elevated levels of Treasury bills 
outstanding have continued to put upward pressure on 
money market rates.  The EFFR held steady at or very 
close to the level of the IOER rate, while take-up in the 
overnight reverse repo facility remained near historically 
low levels.  In offshore funding markets, the one-month 
foreign exchange swap basis for most major currencies 
increased, consistent with typical year-end pressures.  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained 
accommodative, on net, though funding conditions for 
capital markets tightened somewhat as spreads on non-
financial corporate bonds widened to near the middle of 
their historical distribution.  Gross issuance of corporate 
bonds also moderated in November, driven by a signifi-
cant step-down in speculative-grade bond issuance, 
while institutional leveraged loan issuance also slowed in 
November.  Small business credit market conditions 
were little changed, and credit conditions in municipal 
bond markets stayed accommodative on net. 
Private-sector analysts revised down their projections 
for year-ahead corporate earnings a bit.  In many cases, 
nonfinancial firms’ earnings reports suggested that tar-
iffs were a salient concern in the changed outlook for 
corporate earnings.  The pace of gross equity issuance 
through both seasoned and initial offerings moderated, 
consistent with the weakness and volatility in the stock 
market.  
In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions remained accommodative.  Commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) spreads widened 
slightly over the intermeeting period but remained near 
post-crisis lows.  Issuance of non-agency CMBS was sta-
ble while CRE loan growth remained strong at banks.  
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
also remained accommodative for most borrowers, but 
the demand for mortgage credit softened.  Purchase 
mortgage origination activity declined modestly, while 
refinance activity remained muted.  
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets also re-
mained accommodative.  Broad consumer credit grew at 

a solid pace through September, though October and 
November saw credit card growth at banks edge a bit 
lower on average.  Conditions in the consumer asset-
backed securities market remained stable over the inter-
meeting period with slightly higher spreads and robust 
issuance. 

Staff Economic Outlook 

With some stronger-than-expected incoming data on 
economic activity and the recent tightening in financial 
conditions, particularly the decline in equity prices, the 
U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the De-
cember FOMC meeting was little revised on balance.  
The staff continued to expect that real GDP growth 
would be strong in the fourth quarter of 2018, although 
somewhat slower than the rapid pace of growth in the 
previous two quarters.  Over the 2018–20 period, real 
GDP was forecast to rise at a rate above the staff’s esti-
mate of potential output growth and then slow to a pace 
below it in 2021.  The unemployment rate was projected 
to decline further below the staff’s estimate of its longer-
run natural rate but to bottom out by 2020 and begin to 
edge up in 2021.  With labor market conditions already 
tight, the staff continued to assume that projected em-
ployment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual 
downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in 
larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force 
participation rate.  
The staff expected both total and core PCE price infla-
tion to be just a touch below 2 percent in 2018, with total 
inflation revised down a bit because of recent declines in 
consumer energy prices.  Core PCE price inflation was 
forecast to move up to 2 percent in 2019 and remain at 
that level through the medium term; total inflation was 
forecast to be a little below core inflation in 2019, re-
flecting projected declines in energy prices, and then to 
run at the same level as core inflation over the following 
two years.  The staff’s medium-term projections for both 
total and core PCE price inflation were little revised on 
net. 
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The 
staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.  On the 
upside, household spending and business investment 
could expand faster than the staff projected, supported 
in part by the tax cuts enacted last year.  On the down-
side, trade policies and foreign economic developments 
could move in directions that have significant negative 
effects on U.S. economic growth.  Risks to the inflation

projection also were seen as balanced.  The upside risk 
that inflation could increase more than expected in an 
economy that was projected to move further above its 
potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that 
longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than 
was assumed in the staff forecast. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 

In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2021 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the SEP, which is an ad-
dendum to these minutes.  
In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants agreed that information 
received since the FOMC met in November indicated 
that the labor market had continued to strengthen and 
that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate.  
Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, 
and the unemployment rate had remained low.  House-
hold spending had continued to grow strongly, while 
growth of business fixed investment had moderated 
from its rapid pace earlier in the year.  On a 12-month 
basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other 
than food and energy remained near 2 percent.  Indica-
tors of longer-term inflation expectations were little 
changed on balance. 
In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted 
the contrast between the strength of incoming data on 
economic activity and the concerns about downside 
risks evident in financial markets and in reports from 
business contacts.  Recent readings on household and 
business spending, inflation, and labor market condi-
tions were largely in line with participants’ expectations 
and indicated continued strength of the economy.  By 
contrast, financial markets were volatile and conditions 
had tightened over the intermeeting period, with sizable 
declines in equity prices and notably wider corporate 
credit spreads coinciding with a continued flattening of 
the Treasury yield curve; in part, these changes in finan-
cial conditions appeared to reflect greater concerns 

about the global economic outlook.  Participants also re-
ported hearing more frequent concerns about the global 
economic outlook from business contacts. 
After taking into account incoming economic data, in-
formation from business contacts, and the tightening of 
financial conditions, participants generally revised down 
their individual assessments of the appropriate path for 
monetary policy and indicated either no material change 
or only a modest downward revision in their assessment 
of the economic outlook.  Economic growth was ex-
pected to remain above trend in 2019 and then slow to 
a pace closer to trend over the medium term.  Partici-
pants who downgraded their assessment of the eco-
nomic outlook pointed to a variety of factors underlying 
their assessment, including recent financial market de-
velopments, some softening in the foreign economic 
growth outlook, or a more pessimistic outlook for  
housing-sector activity.   
In their discussion of the household sector, participants 
generally characterized real PCE growth as remaining 
strong.  Participants pointed to a number of factors that 
were supporting consumer spending, including further 
gains in wages and household income reflecting a strong 
labor market, expansionary federal tax policies, still- 
upbeat readings on consumer sentiment, recent declines 
in oil prices, and household balance sheets that generally 
remained healthy despite tighter financial conditions.  
Although household spending overall was seen as 
strong, several participants noted continued weakness in 
residential investment.  This weakness was attributed to 
a variety of factors, including increased mortgage rates 
and rising home prices.  Reports from District contacts 
in the auto sector were mixed. 
Several participants noted that business fixed investment 
remained solid despite a slowdown in the third quarter, 
as more recent data pointed to a rebound in investment 
spending.  Business contacts in several Districts reported 
robust activity through the end of 2018 and planned to 
follow through or expand on their current capital ex-
penditure projects.  However, contacts in a number of 
Districts appeared less upbeat than at the time of the 
November meeting, as concerns about a variety of fac-
tors—including trade policy, waning fiscal stimulus, 
slowing global economic growth, or financial market 
volatility—were reportedly beginning to weigh on busi-
ness sentiment.  A couple of participants commented 
that the recent decline in oil prices could be a sign of a 
weakening in global demand that could weigh on capital 
spending by oil production companies and affect com-
panies providing services to the oil industry.  However, 

Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
a couple of participants noted that the recent oil price 
decline could also be associated with increasing oil sup-
ply rather than softening global demand.   
Contacts in the agricultural sector reported that condi-
tions remained depressed, in part because of the effects 
of trade policy actions on exports and farm incomes, un-
certainty about future trade agreements, and continued 
low commodity prices.  Banks continued to report a 
gradual increase in agricultural loan delinquencies in re-
cent months.  Nonetheless, participants cited a few re-
cent favorable developments, including new trade miti-
gation payments as well as legislative action to maintain 
crop insurance that was seen as reducing uncertainty.  
Participants agreed that labor market conditions had re-
mained strong.  Payrolls continued to grow at an above-
trend rate in November, and measures of labor market 
tightness such as rates of job openings and quits contin-
ued to be elevated.  The unemployment rate remained at 
a historically low level in November, and the labor force 
participation rate stayed steady, which represented an 
improvement relative to its gradual downward-sloping 
underlying trend.  Several participants observed that la-
bor force participation had been improving for low-
skilled workers and for prime-age workers.  A couple of 
participants saw scope for further improvements in the 
labor force participation rate relative to its historical 
downward trend, while a couple of others judged that 
there was little scope for significant further improve-
ments.   
Contacts in many Districts continued to report tight la-
bor markets with difficulties finding qualified workers.  
In some cases, firms were responding to these difficul-
ties by using various types of nonwage incentives to at-
tract and retain workers, while in other cases, firms were 
responding by raising wages.  Many participants ob-
served that, at the national level, most measures of nom-
inal wage growth had risen and were currently at levels 
that were broadly in line with trends in productivity 
growth and inflation.   
Participants observed that both overall and core PCE 
price inflation remained near 2 percent on a 12-month 
basis, but that core inflation had edged lower in recent 
months.  A few participants noted that the recent de-
clines in energy prices would likely only temporarily 
weigh on headline inflation.  Several participants re-
marked that longer-term TIPS-based inflation compen-
sation had declined notably since November, concurrent 
with both falling oil prices and a deterioration in investor 
risk sentiment.  A few participants pointed to the decline 
in longer-term inflation compensation as an indication 

that longer-run inflation expectations may have edged 
lower, while several others cited survey-based measures 
as suggesting that longer-run expectations likely re-
mained anchored.  Participants generally continued to 
view recent price developments as consistent with their 
expectation that inflation would remain near the Com-
mittee’s symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained 
basis.  Although a few participants pointed to anecdotal 
and survey evidence indicating rising input costs and 
pass-through of these higher costs to consumer prices, 
reports from business contacts and surveys in some 
other Districts suggested some moderation in inflation-
ary pressure.   
In their discussion of financial developments, partici-
pants agreed that financial markets had been volatile and 
financial conditions had tightened over the intermeeting 
period, as equity prices declined, corporate credit 
spreads widened, and the Treasury yield curve continued 
to flatten.  Some participants commented that these de-
velopments may reflect an increased focus among mar-
ket participants on tail risks such as a sharp escalation of 
trade tensions or could be a signal of a significant slow-
down in the pace of economic growth in the future.  A 
couple of participants noted that the tightening in finan-
cial conditions so far did not appear to be restraining real 
activity, although a more persistent tightening would un-
doubtedly weigh on business and household spending.  
Participants agreed to continue to monitor financial 
market developments and assess the implications of 
these developments for the economic outlook. 
Participants commented on a number of risks associated 
with their outlook for economic activity, the labor mar-
ket, and inflation over the medium term.  Various factors 
that could pose downside risks for domestic economic 
growth and inflation were mentioned, including the pos-
sibilities of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global 
economic growth, a more rapid waning of fiscal stimu-
lus, an escalation in trade tensions, a further tightening 
of financial conditions, or greater-than-anticipated neg-
ative effects from the monetary policy tightening to date.  
A few participants expressed concern that longer-run in-
flation expectations would remain low, particularly if 
economic growth slowed more than expected.  With re-
gard to upside risks, participants noted that the effects 
of fiscal stimulus could turn out to be greater than ex-
pected and the uncertainties surrounding trade tensions 
or the global growth outlook could be resolved favora-
bly, leading to stronger-than-expected economic out-
comes, while a couple of participants suggested that 
tightening resource utilization in conjunction with an in-
crease in the ability of firms to pass through increases in 

Minutes of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
input costs to consumer prices could generate undesira-
ble upward pressure on inflation.  A couple of partici-
pants pointed to risks to financial stability stemming 
from high levels of corporate borrowing, especially by 
riskier firms, and elevated CRE prices.  In general, par-
ticipants agreed that risks to the outlook appeared 
roughly balanced, although some noted that downside 
risks may have increased of late.    
In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants generally judged that the economy was 
evolving about as anticipated, with real economic activ-
ity rising at a strong rate, labor market conditions con-
tinuing to strengthen, and inflation near the Committee’s 
objective.  Based on their current assessments, most par-
ticipants expressed the view that it would be appropriate 
for the Committee to raise the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  A few 
participants, however, favored no change in the target 
range at this meeting, judging that the absence of signs 
of upward inflation pressure afforded the Committee 
some latitude to wait and see how the data would de-
velop amid the recent rise in financial market volatility 
and increased uncertainty about the global economic 
growth outlook.  
With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond 
this meeting, participants generally judged that some fur-
ther gradual increases in the target range for the federal 
funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sus-
tained economic expansion, strong labor market condi-
tions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium 
term.  With an increase in the target range at this meet-
ing, the federal funds rate would be at or close to the 
lower end of the range of estimates of the longer-run 
neutral interest rate, and participants expressed that re-
cent developments, including the volatility in financial 
markets and the increased concerns about global growth, 
made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy 
firming less clear than earlier.  Against this backdrop, 
many participants expressed the view that, especially in 
an environment of muted inflation pressures, the Com-
mittee could afford to be patient about further policy 
firming.  A number of participants noted that, before 
making further changes to the stance of policy, it was 
important for the Committee to assess factors such as 
how the risks that had become more pronounced in re-
cent months might unfold and to what extent they would 
affect economic activity, and the effects of past actions 
to remove policy accommodation, which were likely still 
working their way through the economy.  

Participants emphasized that the Committee’s approach 
to setting the stance of policy should be importantly 
guided by the implications of incoming data for the eco-
nomic outlook.  They noted that their expectations for 
the path of the federal funds rate were based on their 
current assessment of the economic outlook.  Monetary 
policy was not on a preset course; neither the pace nor 
the ultimate endpoint of future rate increases was 
known.  If incoming information prompted meaningful 
reassessments of the economic outlook and attendant 
risks, either to the upside or the downside, their policy 
outlook would change.  Various factors, such as the re-
cent tightening in financial conditions and risks to the 
global outlook, on the one hand, and further indicators 
of tightness in labor markets and possible risks to finan-
cial stability from a prolonged period of tight resource 
utilization, on the other hand, were noted in this context.   
Participants discussed ideas for effectively communi-
cating to the public the Committee’s data-dependent ap-
proach, including options for transitioning away from 
forward guidance language in future postmeeting state-
ments.  Several participants expressed the view that it 
might be appropriate over upcoming meetings to re-
move forward guidance entirely and replace it with lan-
guage emphasizing the data-dependent nature of policy 
decisions. 
Participants supported a plan to implement another 
technical adjustment to the IOER rate that would place 
it 10 basis points below the top of the target range for 
the federal funds rate.  This adjustment would foster 
trading in the federal funds market at rates well within 
the FOMC’s target range. 

Committee Policy Action 

In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in November indicated that the la-
bor market had continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity had been rising at a strong rate.  Job gains 
had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the 
unemployment rate had remained low.  Household 
spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth 
of business fixed investment had moderated from its 
rapid pace earlier in the year.  On a 12-month basis, both 
overall inflation and inflation for items other than food 
and energy remained near 2 percent.  Indicators of 
longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, 
on balance. 
Members generally judged that the economy had been 
evolving about as they had anticipated at the previous 
meeting.  Though financial conditions had tightened and 

Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
global growth had moderated, members generally antic-
ipated that growth would remain above trend and the 
labor market would remain strong.  Members judged 
that some further gradual increases in the target range 
for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sus-
tained expansion of economic activity, strong labor mar-
ket conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s sym-
metric 2 percent objective over the medium term.   
After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers decided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent.  Members agreed that 
the timing and size of future adjustments to the target 
range for the federal funds rate would depend on their 
assessment of realized and expected economic condi-
tions relative to the Committee’s maximum employment 
and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives.  They reit-
erated that this assessment would take into account a 
wide range of information, including measures of labor 
market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and 
inflation expectations, and readings on financial and in-
ternational developments.  More generally, members 
noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of 
the stance of monetary policy would appropriately re-
main dependent on the evolution of the outlook as in-
formed by incoming data.  
With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed to modify the phrase “the Committee expects 
that further gradual increases” to read “the Committee 
judges that some further gradual increases.”  The use of 
the word “judges” in the revised phrase was intended to 
better convey the data-dependency of the Committee’s 
decisions regarding the future stance of policy; the ref-
erence to “some” further gradual increases was viewed 
as helping indicate that, based on current information, 
the Committee judged that a relatively limited amount of 
additional tightening likely would be appropriate.  While 
members judged that the risks to the economic outlook 
were roughly balanced, they decided that recent devel-
opments warranted emphasizing that the Committee 
would “continue to monitor global economic and finan-
cial developments and assess their implications for the 
economic outlook.”   
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 

“Effective December 20, 2018, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re-
purchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven-
tions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day.  
The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings 
of Treasury securities maturing during each cal-
endar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to 
continue reinvesting 
in agency mortgage-
backed securities the amount of principal pay-
ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities received during each calendar month that 
exceeds $20 billion.  Small deviations from 
these amounts for operational reasons are ac-
ceptable.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 
“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in November indicates 
that the 
labor market has continued to 
strengthen and that economic activity has been 
rising at a strong rate.  Job gains have been 
strong, on average, in recent months, and the 
unemployment rate has remained low.  House-
hold spending has continued to grow strongly, 
while growth of business fixed investment has 
moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.  
On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and 
inflation for items other than food and energy 
remain near 2 percent.  Indicators of longer-
term inflation expectations are little changed, on 
balance.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  The Committee judges that 
some further gradual increases in the target 
range for the federal funds rate will be con-
sistent with sustained expansion of economic 
activity, strong labor market conditions, and in-
flation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 per-
cent objective over the medium term.  The 
Committee judges that risks to the economic 
outlook are roughly balanced, but will continue 
to monitor global economic and financial devel-
opments and assess their implications for the 
economic outlook. 
In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent. 
In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-

sessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments.”

Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle 
W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. 
Daly, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors 
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required 
and excess reserve balances to 2.40 percent, effective 
December 20, 2018.  The Board of Governors also 
voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point in-
crease in the primary credit rate (discount rate) to 
3.00 percent, effective December 20, 2018. 6   

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 29–30, 
2019.  The meeting adjourned at 10:50 a.m. on Decem-

6 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab-
lish that rate submitted by the boards of directors of the Fed-
eral Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
Chicago, and San Francisco.  This vote also encompassed ap-
proval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 
3.00 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Re-
serve Banks, effective on the later of December 20, 2018, and 
the date such Reserve Banks informed the Secretary of the 
Board of such a request.  (Secretary’s note:  Subsequently, the 

Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, 
Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas were informed by the 
Secretary of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a 
primary credit rate of 3.00 percent, effective December 20, 
2018.)  The second vote of the Board also encompassed ap-
proval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary 
and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing 
such rates.

Summary of Economic Projections 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on December 18–19, 2018, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for 
each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run. 1  
Each participant’s projections were based on infor-
mation available at the time of the meeting, together with 
his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—
including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-
run value—and assumptions about other factors likely 
to affect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projec-
tions represent each participant’s assessment of the 
value to which each variable would be expected to con-
verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and 
in the absence of further shocks to the economy. 2  “Ap-
propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path 
of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos-
ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that 
best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the 
statutory mandate to promote maximum employment 
and price stability. 
All participants who submitted longer-run projections 
expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, 
growth in real GDP in 2019 would run somewhat above 
their individual estimate of its longer-run rate.  Most par-
ticipants continued to expect real GDP growth to slow 
throughout the projection horizon, with a majority of 
participants projecting growth in 2021 to be a little be-
low their estimate of its longer-run rate.  Almost all par-
ticipants who submitted longer-run projections contin-
ued to expect that the unemployment rate would run be-
low their estimate of its longer-run level through 2021.  
Most participants projected that inflation, as measured 
by the four-quarter percentage change in the price index 
for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would 
increase slightly over the next two years, and nearly all 
participants expected that it would be at or slightly above 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2020 and 2021.  
Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP) from September, many participants marked down 
slightly their projections for real GDP growth and infla-
tion in 2019.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary sta-
tistics for the projections. 

As shown in figure 2, participants generally continued to 
expect that the evolution of the economy, relative to 
their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation, would likely warrant some further gradual in-
creases in the federal funds rate.  Compared with the 
September submissions, the median projections for the 
federal funds rate for the end of 2019 through 2021 and 
over the longer run were a little lower.  Most participants 
expected that the federal funds rate at the end of 2020 
and 2021 would be modestly higher than their estimate 
of its level over the longer run; however, many marked 
down the extent to which it would exceed their estimate 
of the longer-run level relative to their September pro-
jections. 
On balance, participants continued to view the uncer-
tainty around their projections as broadly similar to the 
average of the past 20 years.  While most participants 
viewed the risks to the outlook as balanced, a couple 
more participants than in September saw risks to real 
GDP growth as weighted to the downside, and one less 
participant viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to 
the upside.   

The Outlook for Economic Activity 

The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP for 2019, conditional on their individ-
ual assessment of appropriate monetary policy, was 
2.3 percent, slower than the 3.0 percent pace expected 
for 2018.  Most participants continued to expect GDP 
growth to slow throughout the projection horizon, with 
the median projection at 2.0 percent in 2020 and at 
1.8 percent in 2021, a touch lower than the median esti-
mate of its longer-run rate of 1.9 percent.  Relative to the 
September SEP, the medians of the projections for real 
GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 were slightly lower, 
while the median for the longer-run rate of growth was 
a bit higher.  Several participants mentioned tighter fi-
nancial conditions or a softer global economic outlook 
as factors behind the downward revisions to their near-
term growth estimates. 
The median of projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.5 percent, unchanged 
from the September SEP and almost 1 percentage point 
below the median assessment of its longer-run normal 
level.  With participants generally continuing to expect 

1 Five members of the Board of Governors, one more than in 
September 2018, were in office at the time of the December 
2018 meeting and submitted economic projections. 

2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate.

the median projections for 2020 and 2021 edged back up 
to 3.6 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.  Neverthe-
less, most participants continued to project that the un-
employment rate in 2021 would still be well below their 
estimates of its longer-run level.  The median estimate of 
the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 
slightly lower than in September. 
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2018 to 2021 and in the longer run.  
The distributions of individual projections for real GDP 
growth for 2019 and 2020 shifted down relative to those 
in the September SEP, while the distributions for 2021 
and for the longer-run rate of GDP growth were little 
changed.  The distribution of individual projections for 
the unemployment rate in 2019 was a touch more dis-
persed relative to the distribution of the September pro-
jections; the distribution moved slightly higher for 2020, 
while the distribution for the longer-run normal rate 
shifted toward the lower end of its range. 

The Outlook for Inflation 

The median of projections for total PCE price inflation 
was 1.9 percent in 2019, a bit lower than in the Septem-
ber SEP, while the medians for 2020 and 2021 were 
2.1 percent, the same as in the previous projections.  The 
medians of projections for core PCE price inflation over 
the 2019–21 period were 2.0 percent, a touch lower than 
in September.  Some participants pointed to softer in-
coming data or recent declines in oil prices as reasons 
for shaving their projections for inflation.   
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  On the whole, the distributions of projections 
for total PCE price inflation and core PCE price infla-
tion beyond this year either shifted slightly to the left or 
were unchanged relative to the September SEP.  Most 
participants revised down slightly their projections of to-
tal PCE price inflation for 2019.  All participants ex-
pected that total PCE price inflation would be in a range 
from 2.0 to 2.3 percent in 2020 and 2021.  Most partici-
pants projected that core PCE inflation would run at 
2.0 to 2.1 percent throughout the projection horizon. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 

Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg-
ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of 
the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of 
each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run.  
The distributions for 2019 through 2021 were less dis-

persed and shifted slightly toward lower values.  Com-
pared with the projections prepared for the September 
SEP, the median federal funds rate was 25 basis points 
lower over the 2019–21 period.  For the end of 2019, the 
median of federal funds rate projections was 2.88 per-
cent, consistent with two 25 basis point rate increases 
over the course of 2019.  Thereafter, the medians of the 
projections were 3.13 percent at the end of 2020 and 
2021.  Most participants expected that the federal funds 
rate at the end of 2020 and 2021 would be modestly 
higher than their estimate of its level over the longer run; 
however, many marked down the extent to which it 
would exceed their estimate of the longer-run level rela-
tive to their September projections.  The median of the 
longer-run projections of the federal funds rate was 
2.75 percent, 25 basis points lower than in September. 
In discussing their projections, many participants con-
tinued to express the view that any further increases in 
the federal funds rate over the next few years would 
likely be gradual.  That anticipated pace reflected a few 
factors, such as a short-term neutral real interest rate that 
is currently low and an inflation rate that has been rising 
only gradually to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  
Some participants cited a weaker near-term trajectory for 
economic growth or a muted response of inflation to 
tight labor market conditions as factors contributing to 
the downward revisions in their assessments of the ap-
propriate path for the policy rate.   

Uncertainty and Risks 

In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of 
possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those 
outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should 
they occur.  As a reference, table 2 provides measures of 
forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of 
various private and government forecasts over the past 
20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment 
rate, and total PCE price inflation.  Those measures are 
represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the 
top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The fan charts 
display the median SEP projections for the three varia-
bles surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals de-
rived from the forecast errors reported in table 2.  If the 
degree of uncertainty attending these projections is sim-
ilar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and 
the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, 
then future outcomes of these variables would have 
about a 70 percent probability of being within these con-
fidence intervals.  For all three variables, this measure of

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the 
root mean squared error of projections for 1998 through 2017 that 
were released in the winter by various private and government fore-
casters.  As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain 
assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual out-
comes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal 
funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection 
errors made in the past.  For more information, see David Reifschnei-
der and Peter Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic 
Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s 
Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 
(Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020. 
1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 
that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to 
fourth quarter basis. 
3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury 
bills.  Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, 
in the fourth quarter. 

uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the 
forecast horizon lengthens. 
Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections are 
shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.  Participants generally continued to view the degree 
of uncertainty attached to their economic projections for 
real GDP growth and inflation as broadly similar to the 
average of the past 20 years. 3  A couple more partici-
pants than in September viewed the uncertainty around 
the unemployment rate as higher than average. 
Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections, they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections.  Participants’ assess-
ments of the balance of risks to their economic projec-
tions are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-
ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Most participants generally 
judged the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth, the 
unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core infla-
tion as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly 

consistent with a symmetric fan chart.  Two more par-
ticipants than in September saw the risks to real GDP 
growth as weighted to the downside, and one less judged 
the risks as weighted to the upside.  The balance of risks 
to the projection for the unemployment rate was un-
changed, with three participants judging the risks to the 
unemployment rate as weighted to the downside and 
two participants viewing the risks as weighted to the up-
side.  In addition, the balance of risks to the inflation 
projections shifted down slightly relative to September, 
as one less participant judged the risks to both total and 
core inflation as weighted to the upside and one more 
participant viewed the risks as weighted to the downside. 
In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections, participants mentioned trade ten-
sions as well as financial and foreign economic develop-
ments as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the 
growth outlook.  For the inflation outlook, the effects of 
trade restrictions were cited as upside risks and lower en-
ergy prices and the stronger dollar as downside risks.  
Those who commented on U.S. fiscal policy viewed it as 
an additional source of uncertainty and noted that it 
might present two-sided risks to the outlook, as its ef-
fects could be waning faster than expected or turn out 
to be more stimulative than anticipated.    
Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate were also subject to considera-
ble uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the fed-
eral funds rate in response to actual and prospective de-
velopments over time in real GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the 
projected path for the federal funds rate importantly re-
flects the uncertainties about the paths for those key eco-
nomic variables along with other factors.  Figure 5 pro-
vides a graphical representation of this uncertainty, plot-
ting the median SEP projection for the federal funds rate 
surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the re-
sults presented in table 2.  As with the macroeconomic 
variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the ap-
propriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial and 
increases for longer horizons. 

3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur-
rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach 

used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici-
pants’ projections.

the width of the conﬁdence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median pro jected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median pro jected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The conﬁdence interval around the median pro jected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the
pro jections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these pro jections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather pro jections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.
The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their pro jections.
* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.

Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________Forecast Uncertainty 

The economic projections provided by the members of 
the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 2.2 to 3.8 percent in the current year, 1.4 to 
4.6 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the 
third and fourth years.  The corresponding 70 percent con-
fidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 per-
cent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second, 
third, and fourth years.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate 
these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric 
and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projec-
tions for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion.  However, in some instances, the risks around the pro-
jections may not be symmetric.  In particular, the unemploy-
ment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around 
a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or 
the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart 
would be asymmetrically positioned around the median pro-
jection. 
Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur-
rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- 

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 
As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 
If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 
While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
